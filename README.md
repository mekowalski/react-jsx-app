# React JSX App

This is for learning more about JSX and the fundamentals

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- I created this Application to learn about React JSX
- In this Application I was able to practice and learn about:
  - Child(ren) and Props(kind of, label, input and button are considered children that are Props)
  - `import` and `require` statements
  - Babel and Webpack and other libraries/packages used in a React app
  - ES6 Versions
  - The fundamental differences of HTML and JSX
  - The main 3 principles of JSX
  - DevTools, JSX syntax, accessing JS variables
  - Understanding what ReactDOM is and how it works

- A few things that do not work in the app:
  - the input field types but does nothing with the information
  - the `Click Me` button does nothing
  - there isn't any functionality in the input
